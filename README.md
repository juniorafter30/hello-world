# hello-world
Thats my first repository


Yup, that's me. You probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.
My name is Charles, I'm 30 years old guy from Poland.
For the past 10 years i've been stucked in gastronomy, and totally addicted to not doing anything to evolve myself.


And here I am. Kinda, out of the boat, but gonna try my best.

Wish me luck!:)
